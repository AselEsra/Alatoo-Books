## Project Description

### Main Page

A web application created with Java with Spring Framework which is for Alatoo University. This web application uses ***postgres*** database in order to store the data provided. Since I have deployed it to heroku, any student can access this application and can request a book from the university by just typing the information needed.

You can go to this heroku link and request a book immediately;
